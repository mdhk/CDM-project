## Introduction

This repository contains several notebooks that were used for the project for the course Computational Dialog Modelling.
It also contains several figures that were used in the report, and/or referred to from the report.

# Code:

```main.ipynb``` includes code to extract the data from the CHILDES corpus, 
functions to calculate several turn-based metrics, 
and code to generate recurrence matrices and to compute recurrence rates.
Additional measures can be found in ```main_additional_measures.ipynb```.
Both of these notebooks employ several helper functions located in the ```tools``` folder.

Code for semantic alignment can be found in branch ```ard```, in notebook ```main.ipynb```.
Functions used to prepare all corpus data for GLM fits can be found in another notebook in the same branch, titled
```glm_models.ipynb```

# Figures:
Generated plots can be found in the folder  ```figures```.
